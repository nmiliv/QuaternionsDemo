# QuaternionsDemo
Quick demo of implementing quaternions in code, as well as interfacing them with OpenGL

Currently contains some textures, a .txt of the source (so you don't need processing to open it), as well as the source code for Processing (<a href="processing.org"> processing.org </a>)
Processing is just Java with native OpenGL, it's nice because it's much easier to build visual applications than vanilla Java. I'm guessing you can figure out how to port it to somewhere else, just replace whatever code gives you errors.

This does not currently contain any actual documentation or helfpul code comments because this was just meant as a quick test before an actual project that did include documentation and I did not have time to add them beforr publication. Hopefully coming soon.
